## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm passionate about filmmaking and all things digital-if it beeps, blinks, or occasionally crashes, I’m interested. 

One thing led to another, and now I’m pursuing a backend pipeline career.  
I used to dream of winning Oscars; now I dream of error logs that actually make sense.

If you ever need someone to explain why your code is more dramatic than a soap opera, I’m here for you.
